How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that

was introduced?

    

It compared lines from both texts allowing you to clearly see any errors in code or unintentional changes



How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more

efficient programmer in the long term?

    

You can back track all your files, compare files if the new files have errors that the old files did not.



What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a

commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    

Manually saving makes the saving points (commits) more meaningful and flexiable, Git also allows you
to add comments to each commit whereas Googledocs does not.



Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple

files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    

Changing one file may affect a related file so saving multiple files in one commit is more logical.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

   

git log views all the commits and git diff compares the commits to show you the changes



How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that 
could break something?

    

Version control allows you to find bugs or previous commits

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
